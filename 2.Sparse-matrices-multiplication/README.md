# Sparse matrices multiplication

## Description
Given two matrices, write a program to do multiplication of them.
## Input
```
Your program is to read from standard input. The input is divided into two parts, each part will be the description of an Integer(range [-100, 100]) matrix.

The first line of each part will consist of two integers M and N which represent the size of the matrix (M x N matrix), the following M rows will be the content of the matrix.

Elements in a matrix will be separated by a space character(' ').

The size of a matrix will not exceed 300 x 300. Notice: Problem has time limit, you may not pass if you use brute force.
```
### Output
Your program should print the result of the multiplication,there should not be a blank printed after each end of row, and do not print  '\n' at the end of output.
